I'm a software engineer with a background in **property accounting** and **journalism.** Before becoming a developer, I worked in real estate, property management accounting space for almost ten years. I enjoyed making templates to automate my monthly recurring accounting tasks which initially was the reason brought me to Python and now I want to learn more so that I can create even better things. 
- 🔭 Super proud of my fullstack web app project. [**INVESTABLE** ](https://github.com/olivia-tran/investable-rental-property-investor-tool) is a research tool, a platform for real estate investors, which combined both of my passion: coding and real estate investing.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on **TypeScript, Solidity, C#, Java, Data Structures & Algorithms**

- ⚡ Fun fact: I **love learning languages** either it's a programming language or just a natural language you name it. This is a [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp5WJFkNYEU) of me trying to speak a few of those languages
- 📚 Hobbies: outside of work, I enjoy real estate investing, self-development, mentoring, traveling, rock climbing, pole and aerial hoops.
